Descriptions for each file:
	Ase_bin.rev: The script for ancestral state reconstruction used in RevBayes for binary state traits.
	Ase_tri.rev: The script for ancestral state reconstruction used in RevBayes for multistate (number of states = 3) traits.
	Correlation_binary.rev: The script for correlation tests between traits used in RevBayes for binary state traits.
	Biogeobears.r: The R script to estimate the ancestral distribution of Vitaceae.
	BiSSE.r: The R script for inference, using the binary state-dependent speciation and extinction (BiSSE) branching process.
	MuSSE.r: The R script for inference, using the multiple state-dependent speciation and extinction (MuSSE) branching process.
	BAMMcode_forR4.0.rï¼š The  R script to conduct BAMM analysis.
	Phylo_Vitaceae.tre: The phylogeny of Vitaceae, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.
	Dated_Vitaceae.tre: The dated tree of Vitaceae, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.
	sampling_names.xlsx: The dictionary of taxon names in tree files and taxon names in figures. Some markers are not allowed in tree files,so we replaced them with "_" in tree files.
