Descriptions for each file:
	Ase_bin.rev: The script for ancestral state reconstructions of  binary-state traits used in RevBayes.
	Ase_tri.rev: The script for ancestral state reconstructions of multistate (number of states = 3) traits used in RevBayes.
	Correlation_binary.rev: The script for correlation tests between binary-state traits used in RevBayes.
	Biogeobears.r: The R script for estimating the ancestral distribution of Vitaceae species.
	BiSSE.r: The R script for inference of speciation, extinction and transition rates, using the binary state-dependent speciation and extinction (BiSSE) branching process.
	MuSSE.r: The R script for inference  of speciation, extinction and transition rates, using the multiple state-dependent speciation and extinction (MuSSE) branching process.
	Phylo_Vitaceae.tre: Phylogeny of Vitaceae including 505 taxa, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.
	Dated_Vitaceae.tre: The dated phylogeny of Vitaceae including 505 taxa, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.
	sampling_names.xlsx: This table matches the taxon names in the original tree files and those in the figures. As symbols such as space and “-” are not allowed in most of the analyses, we replaced them with "_" in the tree files.
